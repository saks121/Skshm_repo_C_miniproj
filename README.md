#### In this fast moving world, most of the users need applications which can save their time.  Calendar is one of the applications which can save a lot of time by scheduling event details and thus user can worry less and accomplish more. But, in this modern era, it is also important that we don’t waste much time in scheduling an event. 

#### It is necessary to fix the schedule and know about associated events with it well before so that we don’t forget. For an instance if  you are about to plan up some of your business appointments on the same day ,or planning a day schedule for daily tasks, or manage some of the important personal or business events /functions. What if some someone makes you schedule these things time efficiently, saving your lots of time and helps you recall & organize them easily. This is the motivation behind this application to help user manage his own calendar and get notified in advanced about all of your important events. 

#### The other reason behind this project is that it could be improved to an advanced level, i.e. making an android based app by adding certain features, as discussed in project scope section.

#### Another of the motivation to do this project is to help myself out with working and implementation of c concepts such as file handling and classes, functions and looping structures etc., as recently after learning C I implemented this beginner level mini project on calendar management. 

#### A calendar is a tool that keeps every aspect of our life focused in one place, allowing you to worry less and accomplish more. Using the calendar is the best way to avoid procrastination and general tardiness. The Calendar applications contain the following fields and controls: 

 -  Calendar Date Field – Provides the current date or enables a user to select a date that he/she wants to view. 
 -  Calendar View Options – Enables a user to choose day view, week view and year view. 
 -  Calendar Selection – User can have multiple accounts synchronized to the device. Calendar Selection enables to choose the calendar account that he/she wants to view. 4 
 -  Calendar Controls – Provides controls for each individual calendar to set date, month or year details.
